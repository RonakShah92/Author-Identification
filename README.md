The Author Identification is a classification problem where
the competition dataset contains text from works of fiction in
horror by authors of the public domain: Edgar Allan Poe, HP
Lovecraft and Mary Shelley. The objective is to accurately
identify the author of the sentences from the given text in the
test set. The dataset contains 19575 instances of 3 attributesid,
text, author. The id is a unique identifier for each sentence;
the text is a set of sentences written by one of the authors
and author field contains the name of the author who wrote
that text. The prediction consisted of the probability of every
sentence in the test data to be in each of the 3 classes of the
authors, which in turn quantifies the goodness of the model.
